**Optimizing Maternal Nutrition: Adaptive trials and molecular methods to improve maternal and newborn health (MM4MN)**

**Background**: Poor maternal nutrition is linked to adverse birth outcomes and suboptimal health and development for children. Randomized trials in low- and middle-income countries show taking a daily multivitamin improves birth outcomes, yet many women remain deficient even after taking supplements. One explanation is that the nutrient reference values–which dictate the multivitamin composition–are not optimal. Much of the underlying data that inform nutrient reference values comes from animal models and non-pregnant people living in high-income countries. Another explanation is that we are using inappropriate biomarkers to measure micronutrient status in pregnancy due to poor understanding of pregnancy physiology and maternal nutrient metabolism.

**The overarching goal** of this project is to advance our basic understanding of micronutrient metabolism in pregnancy and contribute data toward optimizing the nutrient reference values for women in pregnancy.

This project will take place in four parts. 
**Part A**: We will conduct systematic literature reviews and identify knowledge gaps to inform the prioritization and selection of specific micronutrients to be tested in the future.
**Part B**: We will plan all aspects of a Phase I trial including study design and sample size simulation, site selection, pilot studies to validate new protocols, obtaining regulatory approvals, and engaging nutrient-specific experts.
**Part C**: We will conduct a Phase I dose escalation study as proof of concept (vitamin B12). 
**Part D**: Building on the results from the Phase I trial and in discussion with BMGF, we will conduct one Phase II dose-response trial.
